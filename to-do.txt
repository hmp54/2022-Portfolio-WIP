1. Wireframe About me, Resume and Contact Pages - DONE
2. Add a footer to the Page
3. Design/implement the background for the hero page
4. Add a preoloading page 
5. Refactor the skills list on the about me page to 
    a grid display so that it is more responsive on shorter 
    displays. 
6. Implement modal pages on portfolio 
7. Fix alignment issues on the portfolio's project cards
8. Implement button animations 

NOTES: 
-The about me page looks fine on bigger displays, but starts 
to be really wonky with smaller displays. AKA broken responsiveness. But the portfolio 
page works fine, so maybe model the about me page on that? 

-The contact page font size is way too big on smaller displays, but looks fine 
on bigger ones. 

-still need to implement the experience page
